When I was a kid, I was lucky enough to spend time bantering with the CEO of a large technology company in California, who used to tell me "communication was key in business." At the time (and from time to time), I thought what he truly was saying was, "it's highly unlikely you're going to be an engineer, kid."

After twenty-some years in software, I get his point(s). One of the best things about having your own company is you get to communicate with clients your way. And if you can do that well, a lot of the battle is already won.

That CEO had an impact on me that isn't done justice in a quick note, but there is one thing in all of it that strikes me as more than coincidence. At a significant inflection point in his career, his entire team left IBM with him to start a new company that went on to change the world of computing forever literally. And in the lore around that, they were a very close-knit team, perhaps even flung together due to their own mildly misfit personas. The history there, and the characters behind Seagate always resonated with me. So did the "Keep It Simple, Stupid" glass piece on his desk.

I think more and more the reasons for "why TradeLlama?" have as much to do with those years learning (by proximity) about Seagate, as it does with the mashing together of all the collective skills the Llama team brings to bear.

On that topic, yes! - my engineering team of the last eight years and I have come together to work on something we're very good at, very passionate about, and hopefully very effective at communicating on. We know trade data as well any shop out there, and we think with our experience and the wondrous ML ecosystem we have to work with, we can help communicate the underlying stories in those large volumes of data. And, ultimately, drive better decision-making around managing risk, operations, and portfolio management.

We'll talk over the months to come a lot about clusters, or if I'm in front of a crowd, "centroids." But what we're really saying is, before you can evaluate / test on an absolute basis, you need to understand the relative trends. And there is no better way to do that than to feed all the buying and selling into our platform.

Most importantly, I also watched the aforementioned CEO lose his company later, and it's something in the tech world we see in a way that feels unavoidable. That resonates, particularly now, and as we work with our clients, we aim to communicate our structural plans openly, be it capital rounds to grow the business, or how we price our deals to facilitate sustainable relationships. Every engineer is here because they want to solve problems we know (firsthand) exist with our clients. Thus, we have an appreciation for how the business itself is capitalized and managed; this a strong determining factor in our ability to deliver over many market cycles.

A story I heard later about Al Shugart was his skepticism of a CFO being appointed CEO of a rival firm - something I understand completely. It reminds me of another business I was lucky enough to be part of in the mid to late 90s. DE Shaw was unlike anything I'd seen before or since - the culture was one where, clearly, the engineers were in charge - for better and yes, sometimes...well, for keeping it interesting. The choice of a Berkely DB behind the Juno email service was something that could never happen in most current tech environments, where stack decision making is very much a populous affair. But a culture where something like that occurs also is one where great things can happen, over and over again.

It's one of the reasons why we have both Rust and Go in our lineup.

And it's an indication that the engineers are most definitely in charge here.
