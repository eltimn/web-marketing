If there is one attribute I want to be remembered for by my peers, that would be sharing knowledge.

Early on in my career, I learned that by answering questions on tech forums, I helped the person asking for help, but I was also improving my knowledge. I often didn't know the answer, but I would spend time, sometimes hours, researching the topic.

Being active in several online communities has let me meet amazing developers from all around the world.

As the VP of Engineering, I always am available to answer any questions our devs (and sometimes non-devs) may have. But I also make sure that everyone feels safe to ask anything. Every time we hire a new developer, I tell them that there aren't silly questions if they get stuck, or something about our internal code/documentation isn't clear, they should ask on our channels, in the open, where all other devs will see it.

By having discussions using an open channel, other devs can jump in to help answer the question. This practice also helps us maintain a searchable knowledge base so that future developers can find answers to the same questions.

We're often asked about meetings, stand-ups, and other traditional forums for peer group discussion - and while every business is different and roles within a company might require different approaches, we’ve found that the communication forums that are written and compartmentalized (such as those in Slack, Teams, and our own Twist), help bridge gaps in language and geography, and encourage better articulation of problems (and problem-solving). They also help to make the team more efficient.

Open communication also helps to spread accurate information across the team. If I were only answering questions in private 1-to-1 chats or calls, nobody else would be able to correct me, and even though my goal is to know everything about our processes, there are times that I have the wrong information. I’m happy to say that everyone on the team, even if they have just joined us, knows they can correct me.

That last point is something I keep present all the time, nobody in my team should feel afraid to question my ideas; everyone is welcome to discuss the choices I make across our platform. I love talking about how I end up with each tech-related decision because it provides a window into my thought process, and I hope it helps others form their thought process.

For me, leading by example means going to our open channels and asking questions that other VPs out there may already know. I believe this contributes to a culture where we help each other, where collaboration is a daily activity, and it is how we grow our platform and our careers.

With my other two amazing co-founders, and the great team we have put together at TradeLlama, we get a chance to apply this same open communication to our clients. We want to learn your specific needs and find where we can help you grow.

To discuss our offerings and explore a path forward, give us a call or send us an email, we’re happy to chat with you.
