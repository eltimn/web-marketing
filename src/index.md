firstIpbTitle: Who we are
firstIpbText: The core team, starting with a small group of committers to an
  open-source framework (Lift), the niche community of Scala developers across
  the globe, was initially put together nearly a decade ago, to address specific
  trade surveillance issues.

secondIpbTitle: What we do
secondIpbText: Apply creative thinking and machine learning to large volume
  trade data so that asset managers can better understand the behavior of
  portfolio managers.   The largest asset managers in the world rely more on
  lawyers and guesswork than actual data, when it comes to assessing their
  critical assets (their people) and how and why they make decisions.    They
  apply computational firepower to investment analysis, but due to economics and
  legacy IT balkanization, very rarely does such rigor come to the middle and
  back office.
