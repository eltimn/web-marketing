  Some questions we are often asked: 


  How do my PMs contribute to my overall client management model? 


  How are PMs influenced by factors we don’t currently model or understand (peers, market vol, asset flows, etc.)? 


  If there is a baseline, can you warn me when a PM is changing behavior? 


  What about spoofing/ layering? 


  Now that I have seen what I wasn’t aware of, can you show me these other things?

In our experience, PMs are evaluated primarily on returns, which leaves aside other vital factors that impact the aggregate business. Volumes of data are so large, dedicating computing and business resources to tackle this are unrealistic. Outside of return, the middle and back office rely on counsel, not data.
