title: What we do
featuredText: "Apply creative thinking and machine learning to large volume
  trade data so that asset managers can better understand the behavior of
  portfolio managers. "
firstIpbTitle: Client Considerations
firstIpbText: How do my PMs contribute to my overall client management model?
  How are PMs influenced by factors we don’t currently model or understand
  (peers, market vol, asset flows, etc.)? If there is a baseline, can you warn
  me when a PM is changing behavior? What about spoofing/ layering? Now that I
  have seen what I wasn’t aware of, can you show me these other things?

The largest asset managers in the world rely more on lawyers and guesswork than actual data, when it comes to assessing their critical assets (their people) and how and why they make decisions.

They apply computational firepower to investment analysis, but due to economics and legacy IT balkanization, very rarely does such rigor come to the middle and back office.
