firstIpbTitle: Client Considerations
firstIpbText: How do my PMs contribute to my overall client management model? How are PMs influenced by factors we don’t currently model or understand (peers, market vol, asset flows, etc.)? If there is a baseline, can you warn me when a PM is changing behavior? Now that I have seen what I wasn’t aware of, can you show me these other things?

Apply creative thinking and machine learning to large volume trade data so that asset managers can better understand the behavior of portfolio managers.

The largest asset managers in the world rely more on lawyers and guesswork than actual data, when it comes to assessing their critical assets (their people) and how and why they make decisions.

They apply computational firepower to investment analysis, but due to economics and legacy IT balkanization, very rarely does such rigor come to the middle and back office.
