title: What we do
featuredText: "Apply creative thinking and machine learning to large volume
  trade data so that asset managers can better understand the behavior of
  portfolio managers. "
firstIpbTitle: What is the problem?
firstIpbText: Asset managers cannot commission resources and budget for
  initiatives that are not front-office facing, leveraging tools in demand for
  capital management (vs. operational assessment and risk). Solvable problems
  linger, particularly as the size of the firm grows.

  How you get there matters. Mixing and matching strategies (and their managers)
  is a function of portfolio optimization. Firms need a more holistic view of a
  manager. Being able to adjust models to the varying needs of the business
  requires a specific type of trade consumption paradigm.


  TradeLlama's architecture is designed for collaboration on trade data, leveraging ML, real-world experience, and modern cloud-native tools.

The largest asset managers in the world rely more on lawyers and guesswork than actual data, when it comes to assessing their critical assets (their people) and how and why they make decisions.

They apply computational firepower to investment analysis, but due to economics and legacy IT balkanization, very rarely does such rigor come to the middle and back office.
